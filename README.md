### Hi there, I am Adedoyin and it's nice to meet youðŸ‘‹

Brief intro about me:

My Tech life started almost 2 years ago. Transitioned from 4th year medical student (now 6th year med student) --> Cloud Engineer
I love automation, coding, problem-solving and learning new skills and implement them to solve different challenges.
Below are the repositories that I used throughout my AWS/DevOps journey while learning different AWS Services, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, Linux, Python, and Bash Scripting.
